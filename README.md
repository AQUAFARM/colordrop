Color a website by dragging and dropping a color droplet from a palette.

Installation
-----

[Download from Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colordrop-interactive-dra/gdoiopdelonmejbbcfoiibojafcpihhm)

Usage
-----

Drag a color from the color palette(Material Design specific) to a website and color designated areas of it (like sections or texts). One can drag a color from the color palette and drop it on any area that lights up with a blue outline, including text elements.

Once the droplet that you are dragging gets dropped on a content area, a fun little Google Material like animation happens and the whole area gets filled with a colored circle.

Browser Support
-----

**Colordrop** works best on latest versions of Google Chrome.

For all non-supported browsers, the extension does nothing and fallbacks to normal behavior without any explicit handling in your code.
